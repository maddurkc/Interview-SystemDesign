- I got a security violation from company called GE Healthcare saying that I'm leaking their information (and I had to write down the 100 rupees bond notary for leaking information)

- This is pretty much a common issue we can expect as we are supposed to not reveal any information by using any organization name.

- And as the data grows day by day in our repository we will be much more vulnerable to Security Violations.

- This is the only reason I had to change the folder names to numbers.

- After looking at the questions you will understand that they are actually asked in realtime interviews.

- In realtime interviews you would expect a lot of cross questions on one topic and this is the one reason you see me writing down the answers of interview questions **in much more detailed way** by explaining what problems it solve and why it was introduced in javascript/react or so on.
