--------

### 2. Local storage and session storage in the context of web browsers.

- Both are part of the Web Storage API which provides mechanisms for web applications <ins>**to store data in a web browser**</ins>.
- They allow the storage of data <ins>**in key-value pairs**</ins> and are more `intuitive` and `flexible` **than cookies**, with a `larger` `capacity`.

#### i) localStorage

- provides a way to store data on the client's computer **for <ins>long-term storage**</ins>. 
- Data stored in localStorage <ins>**has no expiration time**</ins> 
- <ins>**remains stored**</ins> on the user's browser **until `explicitly` deleted**. 
- Changes made are saved and available for all `current` and `future` visits to the site.

#### Features of localStorage:
- **Persistence**: Data persists <ins>**even when the browser is `closed` and `reopened`**</ins>.
- **Capacity**: Typically allows about **5MB** of data to be stored, though this limit can vary by browser.
- **Scope**: Available from all windows/tabs with the same origin (protocol, host, and port).
- **Use Cases**: 
  - <ins>**Storing user preferences**</ins>, 
  - <ins>**saving the state**</ins> of a complex web application, 
  - or keeping user data available for prolonged periods without expiration.  

```js
// Storing data
localStorage.setItem('username', 'JohnDoe');

// Retrieving data
const username = localStorage.getItem('username');
console.log(username);

// Removing data
localStorage.removeItem('username');

// Clearing all data
localStorage.clear();
```

#### ii) sessionStorage
- sessionStorage is **`similar`** to localStorage in its method of storage, <ins>**but it has a shorter lifetime**</ins>. 
- Data stored in sessionStorage <ins>**gets cleared when the page session ends**</ins>. 
- A page session <ins>**lasts as long as the browser is open and survives over page reloads and restores**</ins>. 
- However, **opening a page in a new tab or window <ins>will start a new session</ins>**, which differs from localStorage where data is shared across all tabs and windows.

#### Features of sessionStorage:
- **Lifetime**: Data is **`cleared`** when the tab is closed.
- **Capacity**: Similar to localStorage, around `5MB` of data.
- **Scope**: Data is available **only within the `same` tab**/window that created it.
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Sensitive data that should not persist beyond the session, 
  - such as **form data entries** or 
  - single session-based games.

```js
// Storing data
sessionStorage.setItem('sessionName', 'SessionData');

// Retrieving data
const sessionData = sessionStorage.getItem('sessionName');
console.log(sessionData);

// Removing data
sessionStorage.removeItem('sessionName');

// Clearing all data within the session
sessionStorage.clear();
```
**Security**: 
  - Both are subject to the `same-origin` policy for security 
  - but do not transmit data with every server request like cookies, reducing the risk of interception by malicious actors.

----

### 3. Difference between using cookies and local storage as we can achieve the same stuff with local storage/ session storage as well?

#### 1. Storage Capacity
**Cookies**: Limited to about 4KB per cookie.
#### 2. Lifetime
**Cookies**: 
- Have expiration dates and can be set to persist past browser sessions until a specific expiration date. 
- They can also be made `session-only`, which expires when the browser session ends.
including page reloads and restores).

#### 3. Data Accessibility Across Sessions and Tabs
**Cookies**: 
- Data is sent automatically with every HTTP request made to the server, which can be used to maintain session state between the server and client.

#### 4. Security
**Cookies**: 
- Because **cookies are sent with every HTTP request**,
- they are **`vulnerable`** to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks 
- and potentially to cross-site scripting (XSS) **if not properly secured with flags like `HttpOnly`**.


**localStorage/sessionStorage**: 
  - Generally more secure from interception, as the data is never transferred to the server unless explicitly done so by the client-side script. 
  - However, they are **still susceptible to XSS attacks** which can <ins>**allow an attacker to access storage through malicious scripts**</ins>.


#### 5. Use Cases
**Cookies**:
- Managing user sessions.
- Tracking user behavior for analytics.
- Personalization (storing user preferences and themes).


#### 6. Server Accessibility
**Cookies**: 
  - **Automatically sent to the server with every HTTP request**, which can be used to handle server-side read/write.

**localStorage/sessionStorage**: 
  - **Not accessible to the server** directly; 
  - data stored must be sent explicitly via AJAX or other HTTP methods if needed on the server.

----

### 4. Explain techniques for handling authentication and OAuth tokens on a web application's front-end.

#### 1. Secure Token Storage
- **Avoid Local Storage**: 
  - Storing tokens in local storage or session storage is
    -  **`vulnerable` to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks**. 
  - Instead, <ins>use secure, **HttpOnly cookies**</ins> that are not accessible via JavaScript.
<br/>

- **Use Secure Cookies**: 
  - Set cookies with the <ins>**Secure flag**</ins> 
    - to ensure they are transmitted only over `HTTPS`. 
  - Also, use the `HttpOnly` flag 
    - **to prevent `client-side scripts` from accessing the cookie data, `reducing` `XSS` `risks`**.


#### 2. Token Refresh Handling
  - **Refresh Tokens**: 
    - Implement refresh tokens 
      - **to renew access tokens** <ins>without **requiring** the user to **re-authenticate** frequently</ins>. 
    - **<ins>Store refresh tokens securely</ins> on the `server` or in a `HttpOnly` cookie**.
<br/>

- **Silent Refresh**: 
  - Use `iframe-based` silent refreshes or background fetches 
    - to renew access tokens automatically without interrupting the user experience.

#### 3. Use Secure Transmission
- **HTTPS**: 
  - Always use HTTPS <ins>**to *encrypt* communications between the *client* and the *server***</ins>. 
  - This **`protects`** your tokens from being intercepted by attackers during transmission.
<br/>

- **CORS Policy**: 
  - Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) properly 
    - **to ensure that <ins>only trusted domains can make requests to your API**</ins>, thus protecting against **`CSRF`** attacks.

#### 4. OAuth 2.0 Flows
- **Authorization Code Flow with PKCE**: 
  - Prefer the Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for single-page applications (SPAs). 
  - **`PKCE`** **adds an additional layer of security** by ensuring that <ins>**the application that requested the authorization code is the one exchanging it for an access token**</ins>.
<br/>

- **Token Validation**: 
  - Ensure that the **tokens received from the authentication server are `validated`, including checking the `signature` and the `claims` of JWT tokens**.

#### 5. Minimize Token Lifespan
- **Short-lived Access Tokens**: 
  - Use short-lived access tokens to limit the damage if a token is compromised. 
  - Typically, access tokens might last anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.
- **Longer-lived Refresh Tokens**: 
  - If using refresh tokens, they can be longer-lived but must be stored and managed securely, **ideally on the server-side**.


#### 6. Handling Sensitive Data
- **Avoid Storing Sensitive Data**: 
  - Do not store sensitive data in the token or anywhere in the front-end. 
  - Keep sensitive data on the server-side and fetch it securely when needed.
- **Token Scoping**: 
  - Limit the scope of what each token can do. 
  - For example, **restrict access tokens to specific actions or resources**.

#### 7. Monitoring and Revocation
- **Token Revocation**: 
  - Implement mechanisms to revoke tokens when they are no longer needed or if suspicious activity is detected.
- **Audit and Monitoring**: 
  - Regularly monitor access patterns and audit logs for suspicious activity.
  - Implement anomaly detection to identify unusual access patterns or token usage.

---

### 5. Component composition in React.

- Component composition is a fundamental concept in React. 
- It allows you to **build complex UIs from simple, `isolated` pieces called `components`**. 
- Components can be <ins>**composed into other components</ins>**, similar to how you might compose functions or classes.

```js
// Simple React Component
import React from 'react';

// A simple functional component called Greeting
function Greeting() {
  // It returns a JSX element displaying a greeting message
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
}

// This line makes the Greeting component available for import in other files
export default Greeting; 
```

#### Component Composition Example

```js
import React from 'react';
import Greeting from './Greeting';

function App() {
  // This component uses the Greeting component inside
  // and adds some additional elements
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting /> {/* The Greeting component is used here */}
      <p>This is an example of component composition in React.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App; 
```

### 6. Describe your strategies which you have followed in your past for enhancing the performance of React applications

- Strategies focus on 
  - **`optimizing`** rendering, 
  - managing state **`efficiently`**,
  - making better use of React's **`built-in`** capabilities. 


#### 1. Minimizing Component Re-renders
- Reducing **unnecessary** **`re-renders`** is crucial for enhancing performance:

- **`ShouldComponentUpdate`** and **`React.memo`**: 
  - For **class** components, implement <ins>**shouldComponentUpdate**</ins> to prevent unnecessary re-renders by comparing props or state. 
  - For **functional** components, <ins>**wrap them with React.memo**</ins> to achieve a similar effect.

```js
// Using React.memo for a functional component
const MyComponent = React.memo(({ props }) => {
  // Component logic
  return <div>{props.children}</div>;
});
```

- **PureComponent**: 
  - Extending **`React.PureComponent`** in class components **automatically implements** `shouldComponentUpdate` with a <ins>**shallow `prop` and `state` comparison**</ins>.

-----

#### 2. Optimizing Heavy Computations

- **Memoization**: 
  - Use memoization to cache heavy function outputs. 
  - Libraries like **`lodash.memoize`** or **`reselect`** for Redux are useful here.

```js
import { useMemo } from 'react';

const expensiveFunction = (param) => {
  // Perform heavy calculations
  return param;
};

function MyComponent({ param }) {
  const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => expensiveFunction(param), [param]);
  return <div>{memoizedValue}</div>;
}
```
----

#### 3. Using Lazy Loading

- Lazy loading **helps in <ins>loading only the components needed at the moment**</ins> rather than loading all components upfront:

- **`React.lazy`** and **`Suspense`**: 
  - Use **`React.lazy`** <ins>**for dynamic imports of components</ins> that are not immediately required**. 
  - **`Suspense`** <ins>**allows you to specify a loading state</ins> while waiting for the lazy-loaded component**.

```js
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';

const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <LazyComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

---

#### 4. Web Workers
- **`Offload`** heavy computations to a web worker, keeping the UI thread free from heavy lifting:

```js
// In a web worker file
self.onmessage = (e) => {
  // Move complex calculations to a web worker.
  const result = performHeavyCalculation(e.data);
  self.postMessage(result);
};
```
----

#### 5. Optimizing Images and Media

**Image Optimization**: 
- Use image formats like 
    - **`WebP`**, 
    - Implement techniques like <ins>**lazy loading images**</ins>, 
    - using **`thumbnails`**,
    - **defining image sizes** to reduce layout shifts and loading times.

----

#### 6. Code Splitting

- **Splitting code <ins>into smaller bundles**</ins> *reduces* <ins>the initial load time:</ins>

```js
// Using dynamic imports
// to split your JavaScript code into smaller chunks which can be loaded on demand.
import('./MyModule.js').then((MyModule) => {
  // Use MyModule
});
```
---

#### 7. Efficient Data Fetching
- To reduce wait times and unnecessary updates:

  - Implement debouncing or throttling **for `API` calls <ins>that do not need to be made on every user input change**</ins>. 
  - This reduces the number of calls made under rapid input conditions.

----

#### 8. Using the Virtual DOM Efficiently
- Use the **`key`** prop effectively especially in **`lists`** 
- to allow React to re-use DOM nodes correctly, rather than re-creating them unnecessarily.

----

### 7. different stages of react app

- These stages can be categorized into the 
  - **`mounting`** phase, 
  - **`updating`** phase, 
  - **`unmounting`** phase. 


### <ins>PART 1: Class Components LifeCycle Methods</ins>
#### 1. Mounting Phase
- This is the initial phase of the component lifecycle when an **instance of a component is being `created` and `inserted` into the DOM**:
<br/>

- **i) `constructor(props)`**: 
  - This method is called **`before` the component is mounted**. 
  - It is a good place to **`initialize` state** or **`bind` event handlers**.

```js
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = { count: 0 };
}
```
- **ii) `static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)`**: 
  - This method is <ins>**called right before rendering**</ins>, in both the **`mounting`** and **`updating`** phases. 
  - It is **used <ins>to update the state based on the props</ins>**.
<br/>

- **iii) `render()`**: 
  - The only required method in a class component. 
  - This method **`examines`** **`this.props`** and **`this.state`** and returns one of the following types: 
    - React elements, 
    - Arrays and fragments, 
    - Portals, 
    - String and numbers, 
    - Booleans or null.

```js
render() {
  return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
}
```

- **iv) `componentDidMount`()**: 
  - This method is **called after the <ins>component is mounted on the DOM</ins>**. 
  - It is used for 
    - DOM manipulation, 
    - fetching data, 
    - setting up subscriptions (e.g., timers, network requests).

```js
componentDidMount() {
  this.timerID = setInterval(
    () => this.tick(),
    1000
  );
}
```
---

#### 2. Updating Phase
- This phase <ins>**starts when a component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its `props` or `state`</ins>**
<br/>

- **`static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)`**: 
  - Same as in the mounting phase, 
  - it is **called `before` <ins>the render method</ins> when new props are being received**. 
  - Here, it's **used to adjust the state** based on the incoming props before rendering.
<br/>

- **`shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`**: 
  - If a component’s output is not affected by the current change in state or props.
  - It returns **`true`** or **`false`** to instruct React whether to continue with rendering or not.

```js
shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
  return this.props.value !== nextProps.value;
}
```

- **render()**: 
  - Called again to **`re-render` the UI** with the **`new` `props`** and/or **`state`**.
<br/>

- **`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`**: 
  - This method is <ins>**called right before**</ins> the most recently rendered output is committed to the DOM. 
  - It **`captures`** some **information <ins>from the DOM</ins> that might change `after` the update**.
<br/>

- **componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)**: 
  - This method is **called immediately `after` updating** occurs. 
  - It is not called for the initial render. 
  - Suitable for DOM operations and network calls based on the **`previous`** and **`current`** **`state`**.

```js
componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
  if (prevState.count !== this.state.count) {
    console.log("Count has changed.");
  }
}
```

#### 3. Unmounting Phase
- This final phase is when **a component is being `removed` from the DOM**:
<br/>

- **`componentWillUnmount()`**: 
  - This method is **called `before` the component is `unmounted` and `destroyed`**.
  - It is a **good place to perform cleanup** 
  - e.g., clearing timers, 
  - cancelling network requests 
  - or subscriptions
  - **to `avoid` memory leaks**.

-----

### <ins>PART 2: Hooks Version LifeCycle Methods</ins>

#### 1. Mounting Phase

- In functional components, the mounting logic is handled by the **`useEffect`** hook
- with an **`empty`** **`dependency`** **`array`** [ ], 
- which ensures the <ins>**effect runs only once after the initial render**</ins>.


```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Timer() {
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // YOUR NETWORK API CALL HERE....
  }, []); // Empty array means this effect will only run once after the initial render



  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello SaiTeja!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Timer;
```

#### 2. Updating Phase

- To replicate the behavior of lifecycle methods **that run on `updates`**, 
- useEffect can be used **without** an empty dependency array, 
- or **with <ins>specific dependencies</ins>**.

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function UserProfile({ userId }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchUserData(id) {
      const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${id}`);
      const userData = await response.json();
      setUser(userData);
    }

    fetchUserData(userId);
  }, [userId]); // This effect runs on initial mount and whenever userId changes

  return (
    <div>
      {user ? (
        <div>
          <h1>{user.name}</h1>
          <p>Email: {user.email}</p>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <p>Loading user data...</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default UserProfile;
```

#### 3. Unmounting Phase
- The cleanup or unmounting phase is **also managed by useEffect**, 
- where you return a function from within the effect. 
- This function is called when the component unmounts.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = someSubscription();

  // Cleanup function
  return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe();
  };
}, []);
```


----

#### 8. What is JSX . Why do we need it. Does browser understands JSX directly

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML. It is used with React to describe the user interface components and their structure. JSX allows you to write HTML-like code directly within your JavaScript code, making the structure of the visual elements more readable and expressive.

## Others
### what is difference between access token and id token
     
**Access Token**
- **Purpose**: 
  - An access token is **used to grant access to a resource**. 
  - It acts as a kind of "key" that **allows the holder to access APIs or resources securely**. 
  - The primary purpose of an access token is to **authorize API requests** made on behalf of the user.
- **Content**: 
  - Access tokens usually contain `scopes` and `grants` that specify what actions the application can perform and on what resources. 
  - They do not necessarily need to be understandable by the client or the resource owner.
- **Format**: 
  - The format of an access token can be opaque (such as a random string) or structured (such as `JWT` - JSON Web Tokens), depending on the authorization server. 
  - In the case of `JWT`, the token can carry a payload of claims, but these are meant for authorization, not for client use.
  
- **Usage**: 
  - It is **used by a client application to make authenticated requests to a server** or `API` that knows how to validate the token and check the permissions (scopes).



    code review steps you do
    You have an app with so many fields in the form. How do you show to user? How do you prevent repeated clicks of button?


## Below is a use case. How can we achieve this in react
    5 components that will call 5 different services to get data
    2 components should automatically rerender after every 30 secs
    3 components should rerender on click of a button
 
- use of pure component?
- can we make database call directly from react app? is it suggestible to do if possible?
- What is synthetic event in react. Have you used in your project? What it will do?
